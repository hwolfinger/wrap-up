## Overview
First off thank you Alan, thank you Nancy and thank you Brian.  
Also, thanks Dave, Matt, Lance and Will for lending your time and energy to answering our questions and providing resources and encouragement to us through Slack.

Now, let's begin.

This ["wrap-up" project](https://github.com/exelaration/team-resources/blob/master/ONBOARDING.md) is our first assignment, which we started after doing the [HTML](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-html), [CSS](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-css) and [JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) training courses on Codeacademy, as well as two Git tutorials, [Practical Git for Everyday Use](https://egghead.io/courses/practical-git-for-everyday-professional-use) and [Welcome to Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/).

## Objective
> Your wrap-up exercise for your onboarding is to make a website (can be just a single HTML page) that will use JavaScript to get data from an external REST API.  The details are as follows:

> 1. When the page loads, populate a dropdown menu with the results from a `GET` call to `https://xc-countries-api.herokuapp.com/api/countries/`
> 2. When a country is selected from the country dropdown, populate a second dropdown with the results from a `GET` call to `https://xc-countries-api.herokuapp.com/api/countries/<country_code>/states/`
> 3. Once all of that is done, create a way to add a new country by sending a `POST` call to `https://xc-countries-api.herokuapp.com/api/countries/`
> 4. Create a way to add new states by sending a `POST` call to `https://xc-countries-api.herokuapp.com/api/states/`
